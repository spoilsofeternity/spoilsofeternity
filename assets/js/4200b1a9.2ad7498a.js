One character class with a skill tree\\n2. Different acts\\n\\n    a. Different item types/progression\\n    \\n    b. Improved odds of unique item drop for some bosses?\\n      \\n3. Different mob types in the acts\\n4. A few different enemy types (melee, ranged, caster, tank) to create some variation. \\n5. Refine some of the art to get rid of the super serious aesthetic. The art doesn\'t match the game, and I think creates inaccurate assumptions that the game simply wont satisfy.\\n6. Create unique items that are actually unique, and provide somegame-changing functionality beyond just stat modifications\\n7. Leaderboards, or something that will incentivize playing the game\\n8. On the subject of playing the game, improve the interactability ofthe core gameplay loop, so that it\'s more than just a fire-and-forgetidle game.\\n9. Add audio to the game. And reduce how ridiculous it is with loudsound effects on every hit\\n10. Maybe some type of cloud-driven auction house? Probably not an MVP item. \\n11. Update the way acts and levels are managed. Create themes for the different acts, and update the waypoint screen with some art for each of the different acts."},{"id":"about","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/about","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-14-init/index.md","title":"About Spoils of Eternity","description":"Development of Spoils of Eternity began in August 2022","date":"2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"About","permalink":"/blog/tags/about"}],"readingTime":0.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"about","title":"About Spoils of Eternity","tags":["About"]},"prevItem":{"title":"2023 Roadmap","permalink":"/blog/roadmap"}},"content":"Development of Spoils of Eternity began in August 2022"}]}')}}]);
